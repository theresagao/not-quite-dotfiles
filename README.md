*shoutout to @notwaldorf for all of this cute custom setup* 	♡＼(￣▽￣)／♡

## my personal edits (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
- removed @notwaldorf's `alias vi=emacs` (sry this is lowkey cruel)
- commented out twitter api stuff bc taking a break from twitter

## Not quite .dotfiles
NO JUDGING.

Now that's over: I use oh-my-zsh, and all of this works for that.
If you don't, everything might break and this might open the Hellmouth. :shrug:

## Badass prompt
Looks like this:

- ☀️ and ☔️ says whether your git branch is clean or dirty (i.e.has uncommitted code)
- ⇡ and ⇣ says whether you need to push/fetch commits
- `(´ ▽｀).。ｏ♡` says you're badass

## Tiny care bot in your terminal
On every new tab, you can get a motivational tweet from `@tinycarebot`, if
you've got Twitter API keys set up (I do). Once you've set keys up, and
ran the `install` steps in the last section, then you can do:

```
node bin/tinycarebot/run.js
```

## install
Run this:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/notwaldorf/.not-quite-dotfiles.git
cd ~/.not-quite-dotfiles
./setup
## maybe open a new tab
./install
```

This will:
  - put the `.gitconfig` in the right place
  - run all the `install.sh` scripts it finds (currently only for `tinycarebot`)
  - add `source $HOME/.not-quite-dotfiles/custom.zsh` to your `~/.zshrc` file and do any other `zsh` dances (like copying the `no-theme`)
